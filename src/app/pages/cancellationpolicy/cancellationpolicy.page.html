  <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 09/22/2024</p>

  <p>At <strong>AdriNailsDesign</strong>, we understand that sometimes schedules change, and you may need to cancel your appointment. This cancellation policy outlines how cancellations are handled and when charges may apply.</p>

  <h3>1. Cancellation Timing</h3>
  <p>We kindly request that you cancel your appointment at least <strong>24 hours in advance</strong>. Cancellations made within this timeframe allow us to offer the slot to other clients and maintain an efficient booking system.</p>

  <h3>2. Late Cancellations</h3>
  <p>If you cancel your appointment with <strong>less than 24 hours' notice</strong>, the following charges may apply:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>80% charge</strong>: If you notify us of the cancellation but fail to meet the 24-hour notice requirement.</li>
    <li><strong>100% charge</strong>: If you cancel without notifying us or fail to attend the appointment (no-show).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Notification</h3>
  <p>You can notify us of your cancellation via:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phone</strong>: Call or text us at <a href="tel:3053940807">305-394-0807</a> to cancel your appointment.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Providing notification gives us the opportunity to adjust our schedule and may reduce the cancellation fee to <strong>80%</strong> of the service cost.</p>

  <h3>4. No-Show Policy</h3>
  <p>Failure to cancel your appointment without prior notice (a no-show) will result in a <strong>100% charge</strong> of the scheduled service.</p>

  <h3>5. Exceptions</h3>
  <p>We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise. If you experience an emergency, please contact us as soon as possible, and we will do our best to accommodate you. Exceptions to this policy may be made at our discretion on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <h3>6. Refunds</h3>
  <p>If you are charged for a late cancellation or no-show and believe the charge was made in error, please contact us at <a href="mailto:adrinailsdesign@yahoo.com">adrinailsdesign&#64;yahoo.com</a> or <a href="tel:3053940807">305-394-0807</a>, and we will review your case.</p>
